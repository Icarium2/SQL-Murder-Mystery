SQL Murder Mystery project for SQL course /WU20-Yrgo



HOLY S#Â¤%! Someone has stolen Vincent's computer!
Maybe one of you master detectives can help find who stole it?

To get started:

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Run the database-file with your preferred sqlite-programme.


Vincent is in tears! His precious computer is gone!
Vincent attended a Super Cool Hack Event at YRGO headquarters this evening, he left the computer at his desk.
When he left the event, to his horror, the computer had been stolen. 
By the small amount of information we possess, we know that you should probably start by reading the police-statements under the 'interviews'-table, and go from there.

When you think you have found the thief, enter the following command into your SQL-query:

```SQL
INSERT INTO solution 
VALUES (1, 'nameofthethief') 
```



Good luck, detectives!
